### Key Notes from Articles:

Understanding re-rendering and memoization in React:
- Re-render is caused by a componentâ€™s props or state change
- When a component re-renders all of its children components will also re-render, unless they are memoized
- `useState` is a good solution if the rendered output depends on the value, otherwise `useRef` would be a more optimal solution
- One of the most important concepts for optimizing React is memoization (caching results of a function, and returning the cache for subsequent calls)

[Common React Hooks Mistakes You Should Avoid](https://blog.bitsrc.io/common-react-hooks-mistakes-every-developer-should-avoid-defd47d09d8c):
- Hooks should not be called within loops, conditions, or nested functions since it can cause unexpected bugs
- Always use Hooks before any early returns at the top level of your React component
- The value of the state will only be updated in the next render, i.e. `setA(a + 1)` called 3 times in a row will only work once
- Resolve the issue above by using a functional approach, e.g. `setA(a => a + 1)`

## [Use Hooks](https://usehooks.com/)
**Use Hooks** is an easy to understand React Hook recipes by ui.dev. It is a collection of code examples to help you learn how hooks work and inspire you to take advantage of them in your next project.

## [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview)
React Query is a data-fetching library for React, it helps with fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications.
While most state management libs are great for working with client state, they are not so great at working with **async or server state**. This is because **server state is totally different**.
