## [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview)

React Query is a data-fetching library for React, it helps with fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications.
While most state management libs are great for working with client state, they are not so great at working with **async or server state**. This is because **server state is totally different**.
